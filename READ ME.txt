This analysis of the Ethiopian and Kenyan economies synthesizes the major macroeconomic variables of both countries to clarify their economic trend over the past thirty years and predict the future.

I was motivated to do this due to the recent news that the Kenyan economy has surpassed the Ethiopian one and is expected to become the largest in East Africa.

The data is extracted from the IMF website: I have put the link below.
